            <strong>Heart Disease in Florida</strong>
            <p> 
                Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the state of Florida. 
                It accounts for approximately 20% of deaths in Florida. In 2020 alone, 
                5.2% of Floridians had a heart attack, over 900,000 citizens. In 2021, 
                50,000 people died as a result of heart disease. I chose to assess heart 
                disease, not only because it is a leading cause of death in Florida and the 
                United States as a whole, but because I have lost close family members to 
                the disease. And, it is treatable if a patient has geographic and financial 
                access to health care resources.

        <div class="style-div2">
            <strong>Clustering and Accessibility</strong>
            <p>
                In this project, I wanted to assess health disparities among Floridians with 
                heart disease. I wondered if there was any relationship between mortality rates 
                and access to health care, geographically and financially. What kind of resources 
                are available to patients in different regions of Florida? Is there a connection 
                between the mortality rate and locations of current resources and the distribution 
                of wealth across the state? Where should the state and federal government along with 
                health care providers be focusing resources to serve those with limited access to care? 
                Analyzing the clustering of resources, high mortality rate counties, and counties with 
                high percentages of citizens below the poverty level will help examine these relationships.

        <h2>Data</h2>
        <div class="heading-div">
            <p> 
                For this project, I used two CSV files from the Florida Department of Health's Bureau of 
                Vital Statistics. The first is a file of heart-disease deaths per 100,000 people by 
                county. The second is a file of individuals below the poverty level per county. I assigned 
                this data a spatial component by joining it with a shapefile of Florida county boundaries 
                that I found on the Florida Geospatial Open Data Portal. In addition, I used a point data 
                shapefile of hospital locations in Florida from the University of Florida.

    </div>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="style-div3">
            <p> I performed all methods by importing my data in ArcGIS</p>
            <p>
            <strong>With the county shapefile: </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
            To clip the file to just Florida counties, I used the Select By Attribute tool remove all 
            features without 'Florida' as their state name. 
            </p>
            <p>
            <strong>With the two CSVs: </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                I joined both CSV files to my clipped county boundary file. Then, I manipulated the symbology 
                for the death rate by county field and citizens below the poverty level by county field. 
                This created two choropleth maps which I exported by creating layouts of each layer. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="style-div3">
            <p>
                <strong>To analyze the point data:</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                I used the Kernel Density tool in the geoprocessing tools toolbox. This gave me a raster 
                layer indicating the areas in which there are the highest concentrations of hospitals. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>To analyze the choropleth maps: </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                I used the Cluster Analysis and Outlier Tool on each of the layers. This tool identified 
                spatial clusters of features with high or low values. It also calculated local Moran's I value, 
                a z-score, a pseudo p-value, and a code representing the cluster type for each statistically 
                significant feature. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>To create the scatterplot: </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                I used the Create Chart feature on my joined data. I input the death rate by county as 
                the x variable, and the percent of people below the poverty level as the y variable. Then, 
                I exported the chart as a PNG.

        <h2>Discussion</h2>
        <strong><h4>Map Analysis</h4></strong>
        <p> 
            Looking at these results, we can see that there is a positive relationship between 
            death rate from heart disease and percent of citizens below the poverty level. While 
            there are outliers, and a majority of the points fall within a mid-range, we can see 
            that counties with higher death rates tend to have a higher percentage of citizens 
            below the poverty level. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the hospital location map, there seems to be an increase in hospitals near Florida's 
            largest cities: Miami, Orlando, Tampa, and Jacksonville. This is reflected in the kernel 
            density map which shows the highest density around Miami, then Tampa, Orlando, Jacksonville, 
            and to a smaller extent, Pensacola and Cape Coral. So, we can see that the lowest densities 
            of hospitals are located along the panhandle, northern Florida, and central/southwestern Florida. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the poverty level choropleth map, we can see that the counties with the highest percentages of 
            citizens below the poverty level are located centrally within the peninsula as well as in the center 
            of the panhandle. The counties with the lowest percentages are located on the northern Atlantic coast, 
            south of the Tampa Bay, and in the two counties surrounding Pensacola. The choropleth for heart disease 
            death rates has very similar distribution along the panhandle and throughout northern Florida, 
            but more variety within the peninsula. The lowest rates are located along the southern coast of the 
            peninsula and south of the Tampa Bay. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In the heart disease cluster analysis map, we can see multiple high-high clusters in northern Florida, 
            counties with high rates surrounded by counties with high rates. 
            And, there is a significant portion of the lower peninsula classified as low-low clusters, counties with 
            low rates surrounded by counties with low rates. 
            There is one county towards the Atlantic coast that is a high-low outlier, meaning a county with a high death 
            rate surrounding by county's with low rates. And there are two low-high outliers in the western peninsula, 
            meaning counties with low rates surrounding by counties with high rates. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I think that these results may indicate some correlation between geographic and financial accessibility and 
            death rates from heart disease. I think this because we can see lower death rates, percentages of people below 
            the poverty level, and a higher density of hospitals around major cities like Miami. While also seeing higher death 
            rates, higher poverty percentages, and lower densities of hospitals in more rural counties. 
        </p>
        <strong><h4>Areas for Further Study</h4></strong>
        <p>
            These results are broad and I think that the results would benefit from more extensive research. Specifically, 
            I would like to examine specific areas of the state on a smaller scale, like the area surrounding Miami where there 
            are lower death rates, lower poverty percentages, and more hospitals, or the rural area around the eastern panhandle 
            where there are higher death rates, higher poverty percentages, and less hospitals. I also think this research would 
            benefit from an examination of the spatial distribution of all heart disease patients, not just deaths.
        </p>
        <p>
            A limitation of my study is that my hospital data is not necessarily all-encompassing. The data is a few years out of date, 
            and does include all types of health care facilities like smaller, specialty clinics or urgent care clinics.
